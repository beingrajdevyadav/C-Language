# 3 Top reasons for learning C : 

1. Good base for learning C++, C# or Java later
2. Unix, Linux, Windows, Gaming frameworks are written in C
3. Embedded systems programs are written in C

# Constants = Literals -> Cannot change
# Variables = Identifiers -> May change


# Types of variables and contants : 
1. Primary
2. Secondary


# 3 types in Primary : 
1. Integer
2. Real (float)
3. Character



# Ranges : 
1. 2-byte integer : -32768 to +32767
2. 4-byte integer : -2147483648 to +2147483647
3. float : -3.4 * 10 ( power 38) to +3.4*10(power 38)



# In a char constant, both quotes must slant to the left, like 'A'


# Variable has two meanings : 
1. It is an entity whose value can change
2. it is a name given to a location in memory



# Variable names are case-sensitive and must begin with an alphabet


# Total keywords = 32. Example : char, int, float and etc.

# printf() is a function that can print multiple constants and variables.

# Format specifiers in printf(), scanf() : int - %i, char - %c, float - %f ;


# main() is a function that must always return an integer value : 
0 - if it meets success,
1 - if it encounters failure


# void main() is wrong, correct form is int main()


# Use /*........*/ or // for a comment in a programs


& is 'address of' operator and must be used before a variable in scanf()
